# self-driving-car-v1
Following Radu's Self-Driving Car tutorial series on YouTube.

This repository contains an implementation of the self-driving car tutorial series created by Radu on YouTube. However, instead of using JavaScript as the programming language, this implementation is done in Rust.

## Tutorial Series
The original tutorial series by Radu provides a step-by-step guide on building a self-driving car using JavaScript. The concepts covered in the series include machine learning and data visualization. The tutorials are well-explained and suitable for beginners who are interested in autonomous vehicles.

## Implementation in Rust
This repository takes the core concepts and ideas from Radu's tutorial series and applies them to a Rust implementation. By using Rust, we aim to leverage its performance, safety, and concurrency features to build a robust self-driving car system.

This project is licensed under the MIT License. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the code for personal and commercial purposes. However, the original concepts and ideas from Radu's tutorial series are still subject to their respective licenses.

## Acknowledgments
* Radu and his self-driving car tutorial series for providing the inspiration and foundation for this implementation.
* The Rust community for their excellent libraries, tools, and support in building reliable and efficient software.
* OpenAI for developing the ChatGPT language model, which assisted in generating this README file.
